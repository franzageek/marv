# marv
Mini Actual RISC V

Just a simple RV32IMA emulator written in Rust.<br>
It can run simple assembly scripts, and I'm looking forward to making it run Linux eventually.<br>
Right now, it seems like it doesn't wanna hear anything about it.

Current roadmap:<br>
  [x] executes basic assembly<br>
  [x] prints stuff to the screen<br>
  [ ] runs linux<br>
  [ ] implements floatsv
