Mini Actual RISC V

Just a simple RV32IMA emulator written in Rust. 
It can run simple assembly scripts, and I'm looking forward to making it run Linux eventually.
Right now, it seems like it doesn't wanna hear anything about it.

Current roadmap:
  [x] executes basic assembly
  [x] prints stuff to the screen
  [ ] runs linux
  [ ] implements floats
